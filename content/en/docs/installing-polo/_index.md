PoLo is currently available for Android and iOS devices. You can install it from the Google Play Store or Apple TestFlight.

## Android

PoLo is available on the Google Play Store. You can install it by clicking the badge below:

## Apple iOS

PoLo is not yet on the iOS AppStore, but it is available through Apple's TestFlight. You can install it by clicking the badge below:

<a href='https://testflight.apple.com/join/TjRq5t5Y'  target='_blank'><img src='/apple-testflight-badge.png' alt='Apple Testflight' width='240' /></a>

You will have to first install TestFlight, and then click the badge again, or use code `TjRq5t5Y` in the TestFlight app.

## Windows

PoLo is not available for Windows devices at this time, but we're working on it.

In the meantime, some users have reported success running PoLo on Windows using Android emulators like BlueStacks or Nox.

## Mac OS

The iPad version of PoLo can be installed on Macs with Apple Silicon (M1 processors and newer) using the same TestFlight link above.

A version for Macs with Intel processors might be available in the future.
