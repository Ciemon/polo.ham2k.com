PoLo is currently available for Android and iOS devices. You can install it from the Google Play Store or Apple TestFlight.

You will have to first install TestFlight, and then click the badge again, or use code `TjRq5t5Y` in the TestFlight app.

## Windows

PoLo is not available for Windows devices at this time, but we're working on it.

In the meantime, some users have reported success running PoLo on Windows using Android emulators like [BlueStacks](https://www.bluestacks.com/).

## Mac OS

The iPad version of PoLo can be installed on Macs with Apple Silicon (M1 processors and newer) using the same [AppStore link above](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ham2k-portable-logger/id6478713938).

A version for older Macs with Intel processors might be available in the future.
